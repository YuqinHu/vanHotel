# VanHotel
## cmpt276 group project
The name of your web application is VanHotel. Our main purpose of this project is to classify hotels. We are classified according to the hotel's star rating. One more feature we have compared to general hotel software is that we have also added a classification of quarantined hotels. Because during the current epidemic, everyone has to be quarantined when returning to Vancouver. So this can make it easier for everyone to filter hotels. Our main target users are people who travel to Vancouver, and people who need to return to Vancouver and be quarantined. We will use the Google Maps API to help us complete this project. Because it can locate the location of the hotel, how many hotels have been found.

This project will provide a platform for the user to compare the hotels in British Columbia based on several criteria including the price, rating, and location. Our website will help users from around the world to find the best option of the hotel which aligns with their interest and budget. On the other hand, our website will serve as the review site for hotels, it can help the user in the future to select the hotels. Our website will help users to save time to avoid visiting many different hotel home pages, comparing locations one by one, and checking the ratings.

Main feature: Display all the quarantine hotels in Vancouver for users to choose the hotel which are suitable.
Subproblems:
1.  Our app will display all quarantine hotels on the map, and users can choose the hotel to show the detailed information about the hotel.
2.  Users can login to our app, and evaluate the hotels they used to stay before, users can evaluate a hotel by many aspects in a range of [0.0, 5.0] points, like clean, comfort, traffic, geographical location, food...  so other users can see the evaluation, and decide whether this hotel is for their liking.
3. All hotels are categorized by star rating or the evaluation by other users. Users can categorize hotels by what they think is more important, like some users may like a clean hotel, so they can categorize it by other users’ evaluation on “clean” part.
4.   Our app can also show all the hotels in Vancouver, not only quarantine hotels, it has the same function as quarantine hotels.

 Sample stories:
1.    Allow users to create accounts. This is the first step before users can use our software. (TODO: can also include the login and logout scenarios.)
2.    Provide hotel information such as price, location, phone number to users.
3.    Jump to the Google map to see the specific location.
4.    Allow customers to book hotels on our software.
5.    Provide a platform for users to communicate so that they can provide feedback to each hotel.
6.    Recommend hotels that meet the users’ requirements and needs.
